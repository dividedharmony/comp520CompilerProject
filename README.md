The focus of this project is to build a fully functional compiler for the miniJava language, a subset of the Java language.

The
miniJava
language
is
a
subset
of
Java.
Every
miniJava
program
is
a
legal
Java
program
with
Java
semantics.
Following
is
an
informal
summary
of
the
syntactic
restrictions
of
Java
that
define
miniJava.
Later
assignments
will
modify
restrictions.
A
miniJava
program
is
a
single
file
without
a
package
declaration
(hence
corresponds
to
an
unnamed
or
anonymous
package),
and
has
no
imports.
It
consists
of
Java
classes.
Classes
are
simple;
there
are
no
interface
classes,
subclasses,
or
nested
classes.
The
members
of
a
class
are
fields
and
methods.
Member
declarations
can
specify
public
or
private
access,
and
can
specify
static
instantiation.
Fields
do
not
have
an
initializing
expression
in
their
declaration.
Methods
have
a
parameter
list
and
a
body.
There
are
no
constructor
methods.
The
types
of
miniJava
are
primitive
types,
class
types,
and
array
types.
The
primitive
types
are
limited
to
int
and
boolean
,
and
the
array
types
are
limited
to
the
integer
array
int
[]
and
the
class
[]
array
where
class
is
any
class
type.
The
statements
of
miniJava
are
limited
to
the
statement
block,
declaration
statement,
assignment
statement,
method
invocation,
conditional
statement
(
if
),
and
the
repetitive
statement
(
while
).
A
declaration
of
a
local
variable
can
only
appear
as
a
statement
within
a
statement
block
and
must
include
an
initial
value
assignment.
The
return
statement,
if
present
at
all,
can
only
appear
as
the
last
statement
in
a
method
and
yields
a
result.
The
expressions
of
miniJava
consist
of
operations
applied
to
literals
and
references
(including
indexed
and
qualified
references),
method
invocation,
and
new
arrays
and
objects.
Expressions
may
be
parenthesized
to
specify
evaluation
order.
The
operators
in
miniJava
are
limited
to

relational operations:
> < == <= >= !=
logical operations:
&& || !
arithmetic operations:
+ - * /


All
operators
are
infix
binary operators (binop)
with
the
exception
of
the
unary prefix operators (unop)
logical negation(!),
and
arithmetic negation (-).
The
latter
is
both
a
unary
and
binary
operator.

Lexical Rules

The
terminals
in
the
miniJava
grammar
are
the
tokens
produced
by
the
scanner.
The
token
id
stands
for
any
identifier
formed
from
a
sequence
of
letters,
digits,
and
underscores,
starting
with
a
letter.
Uppercase
letters
are
distinguished
from
lowercase
letters.
The
token
num
stands
for
any
integer
literal
that
is
a
sequence
of
decimal
digits.
Tokens
binop
and
unop
stand
for
the
operators
listed
above,
and
the
token
eot
stands
for
the
end
of
the
input
text.
The
remaining
tokens
stand
for
themselves
(i.e.
for
the
sequence
of
characters
that
are
used
to
spell
them).
Keywords
of
the
language
are
shown
in
bold
for
readability
only;
they
are
written
in
regular
lowercase
text.
Whitespace
and
comments
may
appear
before
or
after
any
token.
Whitespace
is
limited
to
spaces,
tabs
(
\t
),
newlines
(
\n
)
and
carriage
returns
(
\r).
There
are
two
forms
of
comments.
One
starts
with
/*
and
ends
with
*/
,
while
the
other
begins
with
//
and
extends
to
the
end
of
the
line.
The
text
of
miniJava
programs
is
written
in
ASCII.
Characters
other
than
those
that
are
part
of
a
token,
whitespace
or
a
comment
are
erroneous.
